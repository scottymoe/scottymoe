Hello! My Name is Scott and I am a Full Stack Web and Mobile App Developer. I began my coding career at Appalachian State University in Boone North Carolina where I received my bachelors in Computer Information Systems. After my education in Boone, I moved out to Utah and attended a Web Development Bootcamp through DevPoint Labs. It was in this Bootcamp that I decided that I wanted to go down the software developer career path. Since I have attended this Bootcamp, I have been building projects using React, React Native, Ember, Ruby on Rails, AWS Amplify, and many other frameworks. In my free time, I like to ski, play golf, go hiking, and basically do any other outdoor activity that I have the means to do. I also just recently moved to Utah and I am ready to shred the silicon slopes! I hope you enjoy my GitHub.
